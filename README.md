# BMD-HS Dataset: Heart Sound Recordings for Automated Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis

The BMD-HS dataset is a groundbreaking collection of heart sound recordings, meticulously curated to enhance automated cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis. This dataset contains over 800 recordings, classified into six categories, including common valvular diseases: Aortic Stenosis (AS), Aortic Regurgitation (AR), Mitral Regurgitation (MR),  Multi Disease (MD), and Mitral Stenosis (MS), along with healthy (Normal) samples.

## Key Features:
- **Multi-label annotations**: Allows nuanced classification by capturing unique disease states, including both single and multi-valvular diseases.
- **Echocardiographic data**: Includes echocardiographic (ECHO) data to provide additional diagnostic context, making the dataset more comprehensive for cardiovascular disease research.
- **Diverse demographic representation**: Recorded at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Dhaka, the dataset includes a gender-balanced collection of heart sounds, ensuring its relevance for healthcare in Bangladesh and similar regions.
- **Balanced class representation**: Recordings were collected from 20 healthy subjects and 20 subjects for each valvular disease class, addressing class imbalance issues.
- **Rich metadata**: Annotations include disease presence, severity, and demographic information, enabling in-depth research and potential discovery of new correlations.
- **Multi-disease data**: Includes patients with multiple valvular diseases, offering a complex dataset that reflects real-world scenarios where patients often suffer from more than one cardiovascular condition.

## Dataset Structure

### 1. Train Folder
- **Files**: Contains 872 `.wav` audio files.
- **Details**: Recordings were taken from 59 patients in 8 different positions, with each recording lasting 20 seconds. The recordings were sampled at a frequency of 4 kHz.

### 2. Train.csv
- **Purpose**: Contains training labels and corresponding recording file names for each patient.
- **Columns**:
  - **patient_id**: File names in the train folder.
  - **AS**: Label for Aortic Stenosis (0 = absent, 1 = present).
  - **AR**: Label for Aortic Regurgitation (0 = absent, 1 = present).
  - **MR**: Label for Mitral Regurgitation (0 = absent, 1 = present).
  - **MS**: Label for Mitral Stenosis (0 = absent, 1 = present).
  - **MD**: Label for multi-disease patients (0 = disease, 1 = normal).
  - **N**: Label for normal patients (0 = disease, 1 = normal).
  - **recording_1** to **recording_8**: File names for the 8 recordings corresponding to different positions for each patient.

### 3. Additional_metadata.csv
- **Purpose**: Provides supplemental information about patients, which can be used for enhancing predictions or making inferences.
- **Columns**:
  - **patient_id**: File names in the train folder.
  - **Age**: Age of the patient.
  - **Gender**: Gender of the patient (M = male, F = female).
  - **Smoker**: Smoking status (0 = does not smoke, 1 = smokes).
  - **Lives**: Living area of the patient (U = urban, F = rural).

### Key Points:
- **Preprocessing & Augmentation**: Due to the limited size of the training set, effective preprocessing and augmentation techniques are crucial.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging external publicly available datasets for transfer learning is encouraged.
- **Metadata Utilization**: Finding correlations between the valvular disease classes and the provided metadata (age, gender, smoking status, living area) could improve model performance.

## Weaknesses:
- **Imbalanced Dataset**: Despite efforts to balance class representation, some variations in disease severity and demographics may still introduce imbalances, potentially affecting model training and performance.
  
## Potential Impact

The BMD-HS dataset represents a diverse demographic, making it particularly relevant for research and healthcare development in regions like Bangladesh. The inclusion of multi-label annotations, echocardiographic data, and comprehensive representation of cardiac health states holds significant promise for the advancement of AI-based diagnostic tools for cardiovascular diseases, especially in underserved regions.
