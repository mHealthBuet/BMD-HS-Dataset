# BMD-HS Dataset: Heart Sound Recordings for Automated Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis

The BMD-HS dataset is a groundbreaking collection of heart sound recordings, meticulously curated to enhance automated cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis. This dataset contains over 800 recordings, classified into five categories, including common valvular diseases: Aortic Stenosis (AS), Aortic Regurgitation (AR), Mitral Regurgitation (MR), and Mitral Stenosis (MS), along with healthy (Normal) samples. 

## Key Features:
- **Multi-label annotations**: Allows nuanced classification by capturing unique disease states, including both single and multi-valvular diseases.
- **Diverse demographic representation**: Recorded at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Dhaka, the dataset includes a gender-balanced collection of heart sounds, ensuring its relevance for healthcare in Bangladesh and similar regions.
- **Balanced class representation**: Recordings were collected from 20 healthy subjects and 20 subjects for each valvular disease class, addressing class imbalance issues.
- **Rich metadata**: Annotations include disease presence, severity, and demographic information, enabling in-depth research and potential discovery of new correlations.
